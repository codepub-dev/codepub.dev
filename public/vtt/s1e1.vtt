00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hello, and welcome to the first ever CodePop podcast.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.160
It is my exceptional pleasure today to have Boron, a hacker, a math nerd, an ex-colleague

00:09.160 --> 00:10.160
and a friend.

00:10.160 --> 00:14.600
He is also an author of three books and a functional programming aficionado.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
Welcome Boron.

00:15.600 --> 00:16.600
Thank you for the great introduction.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.000
It's a pleasure to be present here at the first CodePop podcast ever, and I'm looking

00:21.000 --> 00:23.480
forward to many more podcasts in the future.

00:23.480 --> 00:28.440
All right, we'd be happy to provide more in the future again.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.880
So let's first talk origins.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.320
How did you get into programming in the first place?

00:33.320 --> 00:34.320
Yes.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.440
So I think it starts usually, as most of us probably, I don't want to generalize a lot,

00:40.440 --> 00:45.360
but I would say for me, it started with video games as usual.

00:45.360 --> 00:51.120
So there were two main drivers in my life, which kind of led me to where I am right now.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.280
I want to believe that those two are the most important.

00:54.280 --> 01:00.320
So one driver is me having access to a computer thanks to my dad, which was also and is still

01:00.320 --> 01:03.080
also working with computers to this day.

01:03.080 --> 01:10.320
So this means even from my youngest ages, I had this access to which I consider a privilege.

01:10.320 --> 01:16.960
And then the other driver is genuine curiosity into things and just trying to understand

01:16.960 --> 01:23.540
how things work and why they work that way and just getting a general sense.

01:23.540 --> 01:27.320
So like I said, it started with video games at this time.

01:27.320 --> 01:32.080
I think the two of the two main drivers, only one of them was present, which is access to

01:32.080 --> 01:33.240
a computer.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.540
The second driver came a bit later.

01:35.540 --> 01:42.880
So I was only, you know, this little kid who was just interested in computers, just seemed

01:42.880 --> 01:46.800
like this magical device that you could do stuff with it.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.720
So there is this game which I remember even to this day.

01:51.720 --> 01:57.000
It's called Crystal Caves from Apogee Software, and it's like this 2D platformer.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.360
And as far as I can remember, this was my first game that I ever started playing on

02:02.360 --> 02:09.240
my x86 machine, I believe it was, some Pentium, at the age of three.

02:09.240 --> 02:14.880
So it's like this little guy that throws out, that fires rockets, has this rocket launcher

02:14.880 --> 02:18.600
that you can use to defeat enemies and whatever.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.160
And I think this is where it all began.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.000
Yeah, that's a common story.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.600
Most of us started off that way.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
That's true.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.960
So you did mention a computer.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.360
What was that first computer you used?

02:29.360 --> 02:33.960
I believe it was some, I don't, I don't remember the technical details exactly because I was

02:33.960 --> 02:39.800
just like this little kid who still didn't, you know, just like the curiosity came a bit

02:39.800 --> 02:45.080
later, like I said, and at this point in my life, me being three years old, you're just

02:45.080 --> 02:49.960
like this little kid who sees some graphics on the, on the screen and just like presses

02:49.960 --> 02:51.440
the buttons and something happens.

02:51.440 --> 02:57.520
And this is like the wow moment, moment that you, that you kind of like appreciate a lot.

02:57.520 --> 03:04.280
But at the same time, at that time, I was not really interested into how, what, what,

03:04.280 --> 03:06.120
what is this, what, what, what is this computer?

03:06.120 --> 03:07.440
What, what does it have inside?

03:07.440 --> 03:08.840
Like, what, what are the specs?

03:08.840 --> 03:13.940
And so I, I for sure know it was some 286 or perhaps even 386.

03:13.940 --> 03:17.880
So this was back in 91, 92.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.640
So maybe somebody can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it was like 286 at that time.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
Right.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
So, okay.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.480
How did you actually got into programming?

03:26.480 --> 03:28.200
What was your first programming language?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.040
Yeah, it's a very good question.

03:30.040 --> 03:37.520
I think there was a natural progression from video games to programming.

03:37.520 --> 03:45.640
And the most interesting bit is that I really have not started programming before actually

03:45.640 --> 03:47.540
tackling crackers and trainers.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.140
They were called like that back then.

03:49.140 --> 03:52.920
So a trainer is basically like this software that allows you, like, let's say you're playing

03:52.920 --> 03:58.200
some game that you have like a thousand coins and you need, I don't know, 2000 coins to,

03:58.200 --> 03:59.420
to buy this weapon or whatever.

03:59.420 --> 04:04.240
So a trainer is a, is a, is a special program that what it does is attaches to the game

04:04.240 --> 04:09.440
process and it's modifying the memory values of the, of the game itself.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.620
So you don't have to do any work in the game.

04:12.620 --> 04:17.000
You just like launch this application and suddenly you have like all the money you need

04:17.000 --> 04:18.280
to make the progress in the game.

04:18.280 --> 04:25.200
So this was one of the steps in the progression that, that took place.

04:25.200 --> 04:32.160
So cracking and trainers, you know, like those groups back then, I don't know, Razer, 1911,

04:32.160 --> 04:34.960
Fairlight or whoever they are.

04:34.960 --> 04:41.440
It's combined with chip tunes and all of this stuff, like this blip blop music you listen.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.400
It's what really felt magical to me at the time.

04:45.400 --> 04:51.800
So before starting into programming, I was really interested in, okay, how these trainers

04:51.800 --> 04:52.800
work.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.800
Right.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.400
So I, you know, of course, you know, you cannot understand these things like before you actually

05:00.400 --> 05:03.440
get into programming.

05:03.440 --> 05:09.320
So the first programming language, I would say, as far as I can remember, is quick basic.

05:09.320 --> 05:14.480
And to relate to what I was saying earlier, there was this game, I think it was Monopoly

05:14.480 --> 05:18.760
or something where in quick basic, you just like have the source of the source, the whole

05:18.760 --> 05:19.960
source code of the game.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.520
And what you can do is modify the code and then you actually affect the game and you

05:24.520 --> 05:26.840
can give yourself money or whatever.

05:26.840 --> 05:33.040
So it started with quick basic, but it wasn't like any special kind of building rockets,

05:33.040 --> 05:35.040
rocket ships or whatever.

05:35.040 --> 05:39.840
It was more like, I have this source code, I have this game, I'm just going to give myself

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
more money.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.760
And, you know, that's, that's how it started all of it.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.760
Nice, nice.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.360
So that's kind of nostalgic for me as well, because we're a similar age.

05:48.360 --> 05:55.120
So what were the games you did use trainers and stuff like that for the most part?

05:55.120 --> 05:58.200
This is on a tangent, but still, I think it's relevant to the story.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.360
Yeah, it's a very good question.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.840
As far as I can remember, the first game that I used a trainer for is StarCraft by Blizzard

06:05.840 --> 06:07.440
Entertainment.

06:07.440 --> 06:12.600
So StarCraft is like this role playing game where you, where you are like this general,

06:12.600 --> 06:16.920
so to say, and you have a lot of units that you can control, but it also has resources

06:16.920 --> 06:18.360
like minerals and gas.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.560
And at some point, you know, and this is so before the, you know, this is before the time

06:23.560 --> 06:30.760
where playing online was even possible where we live, because the Internet was really slow

06:30.760 --> 06:32.880
at the time.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.840
And so I was just going to, you know, play a game against the computer and I'm saying

06:37.840 --> 06:42.160
to myself, OK, the computer beats me and it beats me again and beats me again.

06:42.160 --> 06:49.880
So you don't try to, you know, as a kid, you kind of try to get around the game by not

06:49.880 --> 06:53.880
doing the things that you're supposed to do, but by doing the easiest thing.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.720
So you're not actually learning the game and you don't want to learn the game and become

06:57.720 --> 07:03.280
better at it, but you just want to beat the computer at no cost, at whatever cost.

07:03.280 --> 07:13.040
So I remember this trainer was probably by Rezor1911 and it just gives you infinite minerals

07:13.040 --> 07:14.040
and gas.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.680
And at this point, you just like launch the application and you build like all of your

07:17.680 --> 07:23.200
army with, you know, soldiers, tanks, whatever, and you just like smash the computer.

07:23.200 --> 07:30.520
And this gives, I mean, used to give a sense of accomplishment back then.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.520
But you're really cheating the game.

07:31.520 --> 07:37.680
I mean, it's not how the game is supposed to be played, but it's what got me started.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.680
Yeah.

07:38.680 --> 07:45.200
Another nostalgia point for Rezor1911 and that those guys have like the best chiptunes

07:45.200 --> 07:46.200
ever.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.280
I really love the music of those crackers and stuff.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.880
That was awesome.

07:49.880 --> 07:57.240
So let's shift gears to your professional career or let's get started with your studying

07:57.240 --> 07:58.240
experience.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.640
How did you actually get the diploma before starting up as a professional programmer?

08:02.640 --> 08:05.080
Do you have any formal education?

08:05.080 --> 08:06.400
What's the story there?

08:06.400 --> 08:07.400
Yeah.

08:07.400 --> 08:14.660
So like to continue the natural progression talk, I think, you know, after trainers and

08:14.660 --> 08:21.340
crackers and whatnot, I remember there was this IRC channel on the FNET network.

08:21.340 --> 08:25.200
So FNET was this like crazy network full of hackers and whatnot.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.080
You could find a lot of stuff there.

08:27.080 --> 08:31.600
There were a lot of IRC networks back then, but, you know, like most of them were just

08:31.600 --> 08:36.080
like, for example, UNDERNET was really just for trolling and chilling around.

08:36.080 --> 08:44.920
But FNET was really this educational network that I have to say and admit that I learned

08:44.920 --> 08:46.440
a lot of stuff there.

08:46.440 --> 08:51.460
And like I said, it started with crackers and trainers, but really, so there were these

08:51.460 --> 08:52.460
two channels on FNET.

08:52.460 --> 08:53.960
I don't know if they still exist.

08:53.960 --> 08:59.520
One of them was cracking for newbies, and then the other one was new to cracking.

08:59.520 --> 09:05.520
And you would join this channel and people just talk a lot of random stuff like hexadecimal

09:05.520 --> 09:06.520
codes.

09:06.520 --> 09:14.560
I don't know, WinAPI, functions that you can use to attach to a process, modifying memory,

09:14.560 --> 09:21.800
creating an executable that self-modifies, and all of these sort of tricks.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.720
So I'm like, I don't understand anything of this, you know.

09:25.720 --> 09:33.760
So at this time, I don't remember I still had like the will to start learning programming,

09:33.760 --> 09:38.560
but it was just like this, probably at this time is when genuine curiosity started to

09:38.560 --> 09:39.560
kick in.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.960
So I'm like, okay, I just want to figure out what this is, you know, I want to understand

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
it.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.960
That's it.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.760
And eventually I want to write a trainer myself.

09:46.760 --> 09:54.560
So these two channels from FNET provided that experience for me, which is, you know, there

09:54.560 --> 10:01.360
are a lot of tutorials by Exilion, I don't remember, Fravia, Ork, there are a lot of

10:01.360 --> 10:06.400
like famous names that I have completely forgotten most of them by now.

10:06.400 --> 10:14.960
But I'm getting to your question, which is, when this happens, I'm like 13 or 14 years

10:14.960 --> 10:15.960
old, right?

10:15.960 --> 10:23.720
So in basic school, and in high school, the educational system here was, you know, you

10:23.720 --> 10:28.040
write this basic program, which is really you just read the book, and you just write

10:28.040 --> 10:32.640
the same contents as it is in the book in the computer, and then something draws.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.000
But that's as far as education went.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.720
And in high school, I think it was more like Microsoft Office packages, you know, learning

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
how to use a browser.

10:41.720 --> 10:47.280
So I was like already beyond those stuff, because I was, you know, continuously involved

10:47.280 --> 10:48.800
with computers.

10:48.800 --> 10:55.800
So I want to attribute, like the first starting experience to the FNET network, which is learning

10:55.800 --> 10:58.280
how to crack and write trainers.

10:58.280 --> 11:04.860
And then in high school, something happened, which is the teacher, like, you know, she's

11:04.860 --> 11:08.960
teaching other kids, other students, how to use a browser or whatever.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.920
And then she sees me and she notices something probably that I mean, teachers are probably

11:12.920 --> 11:20.600
good at that, trying to see like trying to find who's who is different from the others.

11:20.600 --> 11:27.460
And then she's like, Well, you know, I think you have a very good understanding of computers.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.460
What do you think about that?

11:28.460 --> 11:31.880
And I'm like, Well, you know, I spend most of my time on the computer.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.320
So yeah, probably, I don't know.

11:34.320 --> 11:40.640
So there is this competitive programming that's happening for high school students.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.640
Are you interested in it?

11:41.640 --> 11:46.920
And I'm like, I have no idea what is what it is, you know, I don't know what CP is competitive

11:46.920 --> 11:48.860
programming release.

11:48.860 --> 11:51.600
So I'm like, Yeah, why not?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.800
You know, I'm, she was like something.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.600
So you know, you don't have to attend other classes, you know, this will be your reward

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
for it.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.600
And I'm like, really?

11:59.600 --> 12:00.600
So?

12:00.600 --> 12:04.440
And she's like, you know, I can go to school and just do computers, yes, that will be the

12:04.440 --> 12:06.160
same thing for like, a couple of weeks.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.480
And I'm like, I don't care what CP is, I don't care about anything.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.640
It's computers just, you know, I'm in it.

12:13.640 --> 12:18.000
And then she's like, Okay, you know, just so she signs me up, she was basically my mentor,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.280
so to say.

12:19.280 --> 12:27.440
And then in this competitive, so this was another highlight of my, you know, natural

12:27.440 --> 12:32.720
progression besides crackers and trainers is when you get to this competitive programming,

12:32.720 --> 12:37.200
it's like this really now when I think of it, it's like this really high pressure kind

12:37.200 --> 12:44.320
of environment where you, you know, you just like sit and compete with other kids.

12:44.320 --> 12:48.040
You know, it's, it's like, you see them, you talk to them, you smile.

12:48.040 --> 12:52.600
But then when all of you sit on the computer, you're like, I want to crush you, you know,

12:52.600 --> 12:58.840
so you're like this egoistic little kid that just wants to be best at everything.

12:58.840 --> 13:06.720
So this is the other, you know, highlight, like I said, where I started to, to learn

13:06.720 --> 13:12.520
how, you know, how to program how to program fast, the tasks were most mostly algorithmic.

13:12.520 --> 13:19.840
So, but it still gave me this sense of, okay, you know, this is what programming is about.

13:19.840 --> 13:25.920
It's, and this is what, you know, you will be doing for the rest of your life.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.440
And I'm like, well, it's high pressure, but I really enjoyed this.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.880
You know, I won several, several prizes.

13:32.880 --> 13:37.560
But regardless of that, it's just that I want to continue doing this.

13:37.560 --> 13:42.600
And you know, and then I actually started, so this is high school, right?

13:42.600 --> 13:51.520
And then after high school, I started working professionally, this is in 2010, for a company

13:51.520 --> 13:56.920
here, which at this time, I don't have like a university degree or whatever, it's just

13:56.920 --> 14:06.240
like borrow with his high school diplomas from, from the competitive programming thing

14:06.240 --> 14:07.280
that was organized.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.920
So I'm like, you know, I need some money.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.920
So it's this period in my life where I needed some money.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.240
And I'm like, you know, I'm just gonna start programming.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.120
And I have a general idea of what programming is.

14:19.120 --> 14:24.920
But you know, when you start working in a company, it's very unlike competitive programming.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.760
And I have to admit, I'm happy for that.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.920
Because I at this age, I don't know if I enjoy high pressure as much as back then.

14:33.920 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, like competitive programming and professional programming are like entirely different sports.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.360
I can easily agree to that.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
Yeah.

14:42.360 --> 14:47.720
And so I forgot to also mention one important thing about all of this progression is I'm

14:47.720 --> 14:54.720
leaning towards, you know, your initial question is, most of my stuff is things that I have

14:54.720 --> 14:59.600
learned, you know, self self learning.

14:59.600 --> 15:06.040
But also, there was another big thing, which is also can be attributed to my parents, which

15:06.040 --> 15:11.800
we had an internet cafe for 11 years, or 12 years, something like that.

15:11.800 --> 15:18.480
And it's it was this period, like 99 until 2011, or something like that, where internet

15:18.480 --> 15:25.080
cafes were the thing, you know, and a huge, a huge amount of my knowledge also comes from

15:25.080 --> 15:29.200
there where you just do stuff and break stuff.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.840
And you have like this support from your parents, you know, I don't know, hey, Dad, I broke

15:33.840 --> 15:39.880
the CPU cooler from this computer, you know, oh, okay, at least you tried fixing it.

15:39.880 --> 15:44.840
Here's some money, get a new cooler and you know, assemble it.

15:44.840 --> 15:52.760
And you know, at that time, I didn't feel like it's something you know, that that would

15:52.760 --> 15:55.360
turn later turn out to be useful in my life.

15:55.360 --> 16:01.640
But you really realize that these small things are basically the you know, what what caused

16:01.640 --> 16:04.600
this this large shifts.

16:04.600 --> 16:10.200
And speaking of school, I, I was really bad at most subjects, except for mathematics and

16:10.200 --> 16:12.640
informatics, obviously.

16:12.640 --> 16:17.440
But again, I had this luck from from the competitive program, where all of my grades were sort

16:17.440 --> 16:21.000
of, quote, unquote, fixed.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.080
Because you know, I spent all of my time studying for the for the competitions.

16:26.080 --> 16:32.520
But yeah, university degree came a lot later after after the professional, after I started

16:32.520 --> 16:34.120
started working professionally, cool.

16:34.120 --> 16:39.840
So I know that it's sort of a spoiler, I know you're currently into academia, at least partially.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.160
But yeah, we'll get into that later.

16:41.160 --> 16:44.200
I don't need to drill down into that just now.

16:44.200 --> 16:49.280
So yeah, past that point, we actually, well, I actually had the pleasure of working with

16:49.280 --> 16:50.620
you for a while.

16:50.620 --> 16:53.040
And it was a fun time back then.

16:53.040 --> 16:59.480
What's the most important, or rather the most interesting part of that collaboration that

16:59.480 --> 17:01.200
we had together?

17:01.200 --> 17:04.400
Yes, this is a very good question.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.320
Just going to give an extra context here.

17:07.320 --> 17:12.280
So my first job was really actually working at an, like this outsourcing company that

17:12.280 --> 17:16.920
a lot of random projects come in, like, I don't know, Java, C sharp, I, you know, Python,

17:16.920 --> 17:19.000
I don't know whatever else.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.060
And I've been working there for like three years or something like that.

17:23.060 --> 17:28.280
But like I said, it's like this outsourcing slash corporate culture.

17:28.280 --> 17:35.680
And so the company that you and I worked together is was my second job, actually.

17:35.680 --> 17:40.340
And the way it differed from the first job was that it's a startup, basically.

17:40.340 --> 17:50.040
So really, I had a very good experience there to be, you know, to feel the beauty of working

17:50.040 --> 17:52.560
in a startup.

17:52.560 --> 17:57.360
I have to, I have to tell the listeners that it was my first and my last startup, but regardless

17:57.360 --> 18:06.800
of that, so startups, I think they, so for sure, they drain a lot of energy from you

18:06.800 --> 18:12.320
and you have to be like very enthusiastic and you just have to find some source from

18:12.320 --> 18:16.200
which you drain this energy and you have to be prepared to waste all of your energy in

18:16.200 --> 18:17.200
there.

18:17.200 --> 18:27.120
But the best part of working in a startup was, I would say, the freedom to move fast,

18:27.120 --> 18:30.880
to research, to experiment and do a lot of crazy stuff.

18:30.880 --> 18:38.320
Like I remember one specific collaboration you and I that we had was we used Libaria,

18:38.320 --> 18:47.400
which is a library for torrents, like peer-to-peer data transfer, doesn't have to be only files.

18:47.400 --> 18:52.080
And then so we built like this browser plugin based on the MPAPI.

18:52.080 --> 19:00.340
I think MPAPI was, it's coming from Netscape, the API, but I think it's obsolete by now.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.320
So it died with Flash anyway.

19:02.320 --> 19:07.600
Yeah, it's been sunsetted for sure, at least like six, seven years ago, maybe more.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.600
Yeah.

19:08.600 --> 19:16.160
So, and this MPAPI, you know, you and I are just like sitting in this pub drinking some

19:16.160 --> 19:17.160
beer.

19:17.160 --> 19:22.040
And I remember, you know, you mentioning, hey, you know, we can speed up the MPAPI video

19:22.040 --> 19:27.520
player that you built, that you're building together with another coworker by using, by

19:27.520 --> 19:33.640
integrating Libaria into it and trying to distribute the data that is transferred for

19:33.640 --> 19:38.400
the video and audio to, you know, between different kinds of viewers.

19:38.400 --> 19:43.920
So it's like this small projects that, you know, you have the freedom to, you know, to

19:43.920 --> 19:48.480
experiment with it and something will happen eventually.

19:48.480 --> 19:56.240
But the thing with startups is that most of the times nothing happens and you have to

19:56.240 --> 20:04.200
be very careful with how you, you know, waste your energy there and make sure that, you

20:04.200 --> 20:08.920
know, especially, I don't want to say pay attention to your mental health because I

20:08.920 --> 20:10.240
was very young at that time.

20:10.240 --> 20:17.000
But if I were to work in a startup at this age, I'm 34 now, you know, it would be very

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
different for me.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Definitely.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.640
Yeah, I can agree to that.

20:20.640 --> 20:26.040
Sort of as a transition question, how would you compare the startup grind culture versus

20:26.040 --> 20:32.480
the place you're currently working at in terms of like how they compare with pressure, speed,

20:32.480 --> 20:34.920
expectations, and so on?

20:34.920 --> 20:37.400
Yes, it's a great question.

20:37.400 --> 20:43.600
So it's, you know, so I'm working for Automattic right now.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.280
I've been there for six years.

20:45.280 --> 20:49.640
It's basically the company behind WordPress, but there are also several other products

20:49.640 --> 20:58.000
like WooCommerce, Tumblr, Word Ads, Jetpack, so all of those things.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.600
And the interesting thing about Automattic is, so I joined there six years ago when it

21:03.600 --> 21:08.160
was, I think I was like employee number 500 something.

21:08.160 --> 21:13.880
And right now, you know, taking, you know, all the people that have left, all the people

21:13.880 --> 21:19.620
that all the new people that have joined, you know, it's around 2000 people right now.

21:19.620 --> 21:25.120
So it definitely grew a lot in this past six years.

21:25.120 --> 21:30.080
It's just, it's a good question because Automattic itself considers internally, it considers

21:30.080 --> 21:33.040
itself as a startup, which is funny.

21:33.040 --> 21:39.760
I would not call it a corporation, but also I would not call it an early startup as well.

21:39.760 --> 21:44.400
I would say somewhere in between in that, right, so you have, you still have the freedom

21:44.400 --> 21:51.440
to like introduce new processes and do changes and make impact, you have this option.

21:51.440 --> 21:59.440
But at the same time, and there is chaos, of course, but at the same time, you're not

21:59.440 --> 22:08.040
strictly controlled or strictly bound by these processes, which most corporations tend to,

22:08.040 --> 22:14.200
you know, get like themselves stuck, you know, so me working in a corporation, what I found

22:14.200 --> 22:20.040
out is that most of the processes that are there are just there for, for the sake of

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
a process.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.720
And it's just like making things complex.

22:23.720 --> 22:29.440
So and in startups, most of the times you don't even have processes.

22:29.440 --> 22:36.040
So right, Automattic is somewhere in between, I like to think that everybody can make a

22:36.040 --> 22:39.520
change to the process as long as it makes sense, as long as it's debated, and as long

22:39.520 --> 22:43.320
as it can be, you know, justified the decision.

22:43.320 --> 22:48.720
And at the same time, it's the chaos, we try to give, to bring some control to the chaos,

22:48.720 --> 22:55.280
but I, you know, it's not like it's unlike a startup, and it's not like a corporation.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.200
I hope that answers the question.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.320
Yeah, it paints an interesting picture for sure.

23:00.320 --> 23:05.720
I'm going to switch gears to your current job description.

23:05.720 --> 23:10.200
And you're not actually doing much programming these days, are you?

23:10.200 --> 23:12.320
I mean, professionally?

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
Yes.

23:13.320 --> 23:18.840
Oh, yeah, it's, you know, yeah, I mean, you know, when you start asking questions like

23:18.840 --> 23:24.000
that, it's, it's like very, very hard to give like precise answer, because now we have to

23:24.000 --> 23:25.760
define what programming means.

23:25.760 --> 23:31.480
And I agree with you, the definition of programming for me has quite changed in the past period

23:31.480 --> 23:37.000
for what's happened is so like I said, six years at Automattic, the first four years

23:37.000 --> 23:43.360
were mostly product work, you know, doing some research, working on a product, doing

23:43.360 --> 23:49.920
bug fixes, security fixes, whatever customers give you, you know, user stories, you address

23:49.920 --> 23:52.440
those, you make customers happy.

23:52.440 --> 24:01.000
And so something happened two years ago, where Automattic has this culture of like role switches.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.520
And I'm like, you know, I get pinged by this random person that says, hey, you know, we

24:05.520 --> 24:11.400
have like this role that you might be interested in, maybe not, but we just want to let you

24:11.400 --> 24:13.600
know that it's a thing.

24:13.600 --> 24:18.320
It's basically for you to help us on the hiring part of hiring engineers.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.320
Right?

24:19.320 --> 24:23.160
So I'm like, wait, hiring engineers, what does that mean?

24:23.160 --> 24:28.440
Oh, you know, you, you know, people who apply on Automattic, you will talk to them, you

24:28.440 --> 24:31.560
will work with them, you will evaluate them.

24:31.560 --> 24:36.200
And I'm like, so this is going to take three months.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.200
It's like, you know, like they call it rotation internally.

24:40.200 --> 24:44.480
So three months and I'm like, but wait, you know, I don't know any of these things.

24:44.480 --> 24:50.400
I'm interested in it, but I don't know any of that, any of the things you mentioned.

24:50.400 --> 24:57.400
And the person was like, well, that's the point of the rotation is for us to teach you.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.640
And you know, I'm like, oh, this is getting better for sure.

25:00.640 --> 25:07.160
And so three months, I mean, you know, so I do my, you know, I hand off all the stuff

25:07.160 --> 25:13.120
that I'm working on, documentation, API, finishing all the remaining work.

25:13.120 --> 25:18.320
And then, you know, I'm like, okay, I'm just going to need like a week or two, and then

25:18.320 --> 25:22.280
I can start three months and then I'm back in into my previous team.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
Sure.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.560
Sounds like a good idea.

25:24.560 --> 25:31.920
And then what happens is the first few months is where you actually, we have like this.

25:31.920 --> 25:37.200
So like I said, you know, we have like these processes internally that are not strictly

25:37.200 --> 25:42.200
defined, but they have like their own freedom in which, you know, so there was this process

25:42.200 --> 25:49.720
of shadowing and most of the stuff in the first few months was me mostly learning stuff.

25:49.720 --> 25:55.520
So it's not like I really evaluated any candidate or interview or whatever, but it was mostly

25:55.520 --> 25:59.360
me being there shadowing and seeing what the other person does.

25:59.360 --> 26:04.880
And you know, it's like this basically learn by doing or learn by watching and you know,

26:04.880 --> 26:09.000
and you repeat like what monkeys do, for example.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.960
And so I'm like, you know, three months go by and I'm like, oh, you know, it's, you know,

26:15.960 --> 26:20.440
it's a lot of stuff I have absorbed.

26:20.440 --> 26:24.960
And what I do next is I just write like this reflection post.

26:24.960 --> 26:32.480
We have like this internal blog posting mechanism at Automatic, which, you know, depending on

26:32.480 --> 26:39.760
we have a lot of P2s where, you know, one P2 might be related to marketing research

26:39.760 --> 26:41.560
and other to code research, whatever.

26:41.560 --> 26:46.360
So we have a P2 for hiring and then I'm writing like this reflection post.

26:46.360 --> 26:54.480
And as I'm writing it, I figure that, wait, so I learned all of this stuff as to, you

26:54.480 --> 26:59.440
know, what it means to evaluate a candidate, for example, you know, asking questions, asking

26:59.440 --> 27:05.240
the right questions that that was my biggest, my biggest gain, I would say, you know.

27:05.240 --> 27:10.080
And then if you ask this question, what response do you expect?

27:10.080 --> 27:14.480
What information do you give with the very own question that you're asking?

27:14.480 --> 27:15.480
That's one example.

27:15.480 --> 27:22.440
You know, another example is evaluating their, you know, the candidate's research qualities

27:22.440 --> 27:24.040
or communication qualities.

27:24.040 --> 27:26.640
So what does it mean to even communicate?

27:26.640 --> 27:36.160
And you know, it starts a bit getting into this like philosophy around, you know, programming

27:36.160 --> 27:41.160
and like what you said, you know, do less programming, but do more of the stuff that

27:41.160 --> 27:42.560
is about programming.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.560
So right.

27:43.560 --> 27:49.960
You know, you just like take a step back and you go on this meta level that you say, OK,

27:49.960 --> 27:54.320
I'm not going to do programming, but I'm going to do stuff about programming.

27:54.320 --> 28:02.360
And so like three months in the rotation, I did nothing productive here besides me learning.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.400
I want to stay more.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.440
I want to I want to actually apply the stuff that I learned.

28:06.440 --> 28:11.960
So, you know, it's like you buy, I don't know, a shovel and then somebody teaches you how

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
to use it.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.400
And then you're like, OK, you know, I'm selling this show.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.400
I know how to use it.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.400
And that's it.

28:17.400 --> 28:20.240
But you really want to build a house, right?

28:20.240 --> 28:26.560
So we decide internally that I should extend my rotation to another six months.

28:26.560 --> 28:33.440
And at this time is where you actually get to apply all the quote unquote theoretical

28:33.440 --> 28:39.920
parts that you that you learn and practice is, you know, practice makes perfect.

28:39.920 --> 28:46.800
And this is where I realized, wait, I don't really want to go back to programming.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.520
I want to stay here and I want to be doing this.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.440
This is actually a really good driver for me.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.920
I'm learning a lot of new stuff.

28:53.920 --> 29:00.640
I'm, you know, working with people, working with random people, seeing random solutions,

29:00.640 --> 29:04.680
trying to understand why people arrived with that solution.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.920
What were they thinking when they wrote all of this code?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.360
How could have they done it differently?

29:11.360 --> 29:16.160
So all of these things kind of like, you know, it starts getting closer and closer to the

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
philosophy.

29:17.160 --> 29:24.080
And to this day, we decided to stop the rotation and do like the full roll switch and yes,

29:24.080 --> 29:26.960
I'm now part of the developer experience at Automatic.

29:26.960 --> 29:33.440
We're still working with hiring, but also other stuff like, you know, tweaking internal

29:33.440 --> 29:40.960
processes, working on tooling, developer mentorship, just started doing that a few weeks ago.

29:40.960 --> 29:45.720
So yeah, I'm definitely still excited about the position and I'm still learning.

29:45.720 --> 29:49.400
And I'm happy to be there.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.400
Glad to hear that.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.800
And that's an awesome transition to my next question, actually.

29:53.800 --> 29:59.400
Currently Devex and DevRel and all of the dev star professions are sort of a hot topic.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.120
To you, what does Devex mean?

30:01.120 --> 30:06.720
How would you describe it in layman's terms, let's say?

30:06.720 --> 30:09.080
Yes.

30:09.080 --> 30:12.320
It's another good question, I would say.

30:12.320 --> 30:17.480
My take of it is, I don't know if I can give a general definition of it, but my take on

30:17.480 --> 30:24.800
it is that Devex, DevRel, whatever you want to call it, is closely tied to the company

30:24.800 --> 30:25.800
culture, right?

30:25.800 --> 30:31.000
So what I mean by this is every company has its own culture that they are trying to follow,

30:31.000 --> 30:32.400
like a mission statement or whatever.

30:32.400 --> 30:36.400
And I used to be very skeptical of those things when I was younger, like, you know, who needs

30:36.400 --> 30:39.760
this BS or whatever.

30:39.760 --> 30:46.180
But there is a lot of value in that, which once you define this, it will dictate most

30:46.180 --> 30:49.840
of the parts that will be happening in your company, right?

30:49.840 --> 30:54.360
So for example, Automatic has this creed, which it's a long creed, but one of the parts

30:54.360 --> 30:55.880
is communication is oxygen.

30:55.880 --> 31:04.120
So it really means that Automatic, given it's a remote and distributed company with people

31:04.120 --> 31:10.320
working from all across the globe and our main tools are Slack and GitHub and Zoom.

31:10.320 --> 31:16.920
So if you cannot communicate, you know, not much can happen.

31:16.920 --> 31:24.120
So back to the question, I think Devex and how it relates actually to hiring, for example,

31:24.120 --> 31:27.560
at Automatic, we pay a lot of attention to how people communicate.

31:27.560 --> 31:32.240
And we also set the expectations and give them context around how we do it at Automatic.

31:32.240 --> 31:38.120
You know, obviously you cannot force a person to communicate this way or do that way or

31:38.120 --> 31:45.480
do this the other way, but we give them information as far, you know, this is how things work

31:45.480 --> 31:46.920
at Automatic.

31:46.920 --> 31:52.200
So this dictates, for example, the hiring process.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.760
And then another part of the creed is I will never stop learning.

31:55.760 --> 32:01.080
So Automatic says something like, you know, we will pay you a lot of money for your self

32:01.080 --> 32:03.000
growth, for whatever.

32:03.000 --> 32:11.240
So by nature, you know, this program of developer mentorship gets born and then it's really

32:11.240 --> 32:12.680
driven by the culture, right?

32:12.680 --> 32:18.680
So I will never stop learning is basically the developer mentorship, which is still under

32:18.680 --> 32:21.280
the umbrella of Devex.

32:21.280 --> 32:31.600
So to give a short answer, I think don't pay attention to a lot, I mean, obviously, no,

32:31.600 --> 32:37.680
it's all about people and about computers, Devex and DevRel, like you wrote on your one

32:37.680 --> 32:41.360
of your blog posts that, you know, developer relations.

32:41.360 --> 32:46.840
But at the same time, if you want to get closer to what it really means to be doing DevRel

32:46.840 --> 32:57.280
is start at the top, which is the company culture, and then, you know, go bottom to

32:57.280 --> 33:01.560
the Atom level, to the unit level, which is basically the programmer and the employees.

33:01.560 --> 33:12.520
And in my understanding, Devex and DevRel, what they do is they sort of bring the culture,

33:12.520 --> 33:15.560
they're like this law enforcement of culture.

33:15.560 --> 33:22.360
I don't want to use the word enforcement, I think it's too harsh of a word, but something

33:22.360 --> 33:28.920
that would give other people, you know, so what happens is usually programmers, they

33:28.920 --> 33:35.800
are like in this everyday cycle where they program, code, test, review, QA, repeat.

33:35.800 --> 33:41.020
It's very easy to forget what company is it you're working for, what are your options

33:41.020 --> 33:43.280
for self growth, all of those stuff.

33:43.280 --> 33:50.800
So I think there needs to be someone there to, like, what got me here to the hiring rotation

33:50.800 --> 33:51.800
is I got pinged.

33:51.800 --> 33:56.360
It was a thing in automatic, but I was so busy with my day-to-day activities that I'm

33:56.360 --> 34:01.400
like, you know, I don't know what else, you know, what options automatic gives.

34:01.400 --> 34:06.560
So like DevEx, DevRel to me is where, you know, there are a group of people that take

34:06.560 --> 34:12.320
the culture and, you know, they just like try to spread it among the people.

34:12.320 --> 34:16.760
And you know, like this is the, like when you go to a new city and visit, you know,

34:16.760 --> 34:21.440
you pay attention to the architecture, to the culture, but you do that on purpose when

34:21.440 --> 34:22.960
you're a tourist.

34:22.960 --> 34:27.080
But DevEx is like this tourist guide for the company.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.080
This is my take on it.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.080
Cool.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.080
Cool.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.080
Okay.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.360
That's an interesting thing that would easily describe like what for the most part internal

34:34.360 --> 34:35.440
DevRels do.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.520
And I do agree with that definition.

34:37.520 --> 34:41.900
It's interesting that you mentioned tourism and tourists because you recently had a sabbatical.

34:41.900 --> 34:48.080
And can you tell us more about what a sabbatical is and how they work inside Automattic?

34:48.080 --> 34:49.800
Yes.

34:49.800 --> 35:12.260
So yeah, I started working professionally in 2010 and my first sabbatical was in 2011.
